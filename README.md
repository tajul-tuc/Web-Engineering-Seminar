# Web-Engineering-SeminarProseminar Web Engineering im Winter Semester 2021
Data augmentation is a practice used in statistical analysis by inserting slightly tweaked versions of existing data including newly generated synthetic data from observed theory to enhance the volume of information. It appears as a regularization term when training a machine learning model, and prevents unnecessary overfitting. In data processing, it is intrinsically tied to oversampling.
The benefit of data augmentation is that it won't modify existing data, but it will ensure you get more information from your current data. And once we have more training data, we can look forward to creating a better model for our test data set.

In this seminar i learn the practical use of data augmentation with natural language processing. If anyone want to learn data augmentation, in this folder in my index.html you will get the access to read my full paper. Happy Reading!!<>
